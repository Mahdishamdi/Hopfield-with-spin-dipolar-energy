Description

This project simulates a lattice spin system using Monte Carlo methods. The code implements functions to generate a lattice, compute interaction energies, and perform spin inversions based on temperature-dependent probabilities. The simulation collects data on energy variations across different temperatures and visualizes the results.

Features

Generates an NxN spin lattice

Computes interaction energies using distance matrices

Implements Metropolis-Hastings spin flipping algorithm

Perturbs and updates spin configurations

Visualizes energy changes with temperature
